Hi, I`m Xinyue Liang, a third-year master's student in the Department of Astronomy at Xiamen University, working in the research group supervised by [Prof. Fang Taotao](https://cpst.xmu.edu.cn/eng/info/1203/1212.htm). Currently, I mainly work with [Dr. Si-Yue Yu](https://siyue.github.io/home/), and [Prof Luis C. Ho](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~lho/) on the quantification of galaxy structures and morphologies.

### 1. How robust can we identify and quantify stellar bars using JWST observations? (*Paper in prep*)

Advisors: [Dr. Si-Yue Yu](https://siyue.github.io/home/), [Prof. Fang Taotao](https://cpst.xmu.edu.cn/eng/info/1203/1212.htm), and [Prof Luis C. Ho](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~lho/)


In this study, our primary goal is to quantitatively analyze the impact of observational limitations on the identification and quantification of bars. To achieve this, we use a sample of nearby barred galaxies from DESI to create simulated galaxy images with varying levels of resolution and signal-to-noise ratios. We also take advantage of the simulated CEERS images generated by [Yu (2023)]. Subsequently, we re-identify and re-measure the bars in these simulated images and compare the results to their intrinsic values. Our findings reveal that under the typical observation conditions of JWST CEERS, resolution significantly affects both bar identification and quantification, while noise has a relatively minor impact. Furthermore, we discover that approximately 50% of barred galaxies in the local Universe can go undetected at z=3.0 when considering only the effects of resolution degradation, angular disk size changes due to distance, and intrinsic evolution. Additionally, we derive functions to correct the observational biases for the semimajor-axis and ellipticity of bars.

### 2. A new bulge type indicator from the principal component analysis of surface density proﬁle

Advisors: [Dr. Si-Yue Yu](https://siyue.github.io/home/), [Prof. Fang Taotao](https://cpst.xmu.edu.cn/eng/info/1203/1212.htm), and [Prof Luis C. Ho](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~lho/)

In this study, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the surface density profiles (SDPs) of galaxies obtained from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). Our analysis reveals that the PCA results are closely linked to the shape of the SDPs, enabling us to quantitatively estimate the contribution of the bulge component in galaxies. This leads us to introduce a novel bulge type indicator, which demonstrates strong agreement with the traditional bulge indicator, ∆<µe>. Notably, our approach offers the advantage of maintaining accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity.


### 3. The properties of barred galaxies in TNG50 

*Ongoing* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Advisors:  [Dr. Si-Yue Yu](https://siyue.github.io/home/), [Prof. Fang Taotao](https://cpst.xmu.edu.cn/eng/info/1203/1212.htm), and [Prof Luis C. Ho](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~lho/)

In this study, our primary goal is to quantify barred galaxies from mock images of TNG50 and subsequently compare these properties with real observations. We employ ellipse fitting, a common technique in observational studies, to identify and quantify bars. Currently, we have obtained measurements for the semi-major axis and ellipticity of the bars in both TNG50 and DESI, and our next step involves a quantitative comparison of these findings.
